- **Features**: Strict type checking, ESNext support

### Tailwind CSS
- **Version**: 3.x
- **Configuration**: Located in `tailwind.config.mjs`
- **Extensions**: Typography plugin for content styling

## Development Environment

### Package Management
- Using npm for dependency management
- Key dependencies in `package.json`:
  - Astro core and plugins
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS and plugins
  - ESLint and Prettier for code quality

### Build Process
- Astro's integrated build system
- Development server with hot module replacement
- Production builds with optimized assets

### Code Quality Tools
- ESLint for code linting
- Prettier for code formatting
- TypeScript for type checking
- Configuration in `.eslintrc`, `.prettierrc`

## Deployment Strategy

### Hosting
- Static site hosting platform (TBD: Netlify, Vercel, or similar)
- CDN integration for improved performance

### CI/CD
- Automated deployments triggered by repository changes
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- Production deployments from main branch

## Browser Compatibility

### Target Browsers
- Modern evergreen browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Limited support for IE11 (basic functionality)
- Mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)

### Progressive Enhancement
- Core content accessible without JavaScript
- Enhanced features with client-side hydration
- Responsive design for all device sizes

## Third-Party Integrations

### Form Handling
- Contact form submissions via server-less functions
- Email notifications for inquiries

### Analytics
- Lightweight analytics for visitor tracking
- Performance monitoring

### SEO Optimization
- Meta tags managed through Astro components
- Structured data for rich search results
- Sitemap generation

## Performance Considerations

### Critical Metrics
- First Contentful Paint (FCP) target: < 1.5s
- Largest Contentful Paint (LCP) target: < 2.5s
- Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) target: < 0.1
- First Input Delay (FID) target: < 100ms

### Optimization Techniques
- Image optimization with appropriate formats and lazy loading
- Font loading optimization with font-display: swap
- Minimal JS payload through partial hydration
- Critical CSS inlining

## Security Considerations

### Content Security
- Strict Content Security Policy
- HTTPS enforcement
- Form validation and sanitization

### Data Protection
- No user data stored on client
- Secure handling of form submissions
- Compliance with privacy regulations
