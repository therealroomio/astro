# Gulf Builders Project Rules

## Project Intelligence

### Critical Paths
- All page components should be in `src/pages`
- All reusable components should be in `src/components`
- Layouts should be in `src/layouts`
- Content collections should be in `src/content`

### Coding Patterns
- Use TypeScript for all components and utilities
- Follow Astro's file-based routing conventions
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling with minimal custom CSS
- Prioritize static site generation over client-side rendering
- Use partial hydration with client:* directives only when necessary

### Component Structure
- Each component should have a brief header comment describing its purpose
- Props interfaces should be defined for all components
- Follow a consistent naming convention: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions/variables

### Content Management
- Use Astro's content collections for structured content
- Define schemas for all content types
- Organize content by type (projects, services, team members)

### Performance Guidelines
- Optimize images before adding them to the project
- Minimize client-side JavaScript
- Implement lazy loading for images and heavy components
- Keep component dependencies minimal

### Documentation
- Update Memory Bank files when making significant changes
- Document complex components with detailed comments
- Note any deviations from standard patterns

## Project Preferences
- Clean, minimal design aesthetic
- Mobile-first approach to responsive design
- Strong visual emphasis on portfolio items
- Clear call-to-actions on all pages
- Consistent branding elements throughout

## Evolution Notes
- Project started with standard Astro setup using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- Memory Bank documentation established as the source of truth for project context
- Directory structure follows Astro conventions with additional organization for components and content
